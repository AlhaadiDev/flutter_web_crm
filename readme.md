## âœ… Flutter Web Setup & Build Commands

Make sure Flutter is configured to support web:

1. flutter config --enable-web
2. flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons
ğŸ›  This disables icon tree shaking to avoid font subsetting issues.

After a successful build, your compiled app will be located in the build/web directory.
