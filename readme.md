# 🚀 Flutter Web CRM

This is a simple **Flutter Web application for CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**.

---

## ✅ Flutter Web Setup & Build Commands

Make sure Flutter is configured to support web:

```bash
flutter config --enable-web
Then, build the project for release:

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons
🛠 This disables icon tree shaking to avoid font subsetting issues.

After a successful build, your compiled app will be located in the build/web directory.
